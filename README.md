# SS14 Prototype Editor

VS Code extension for editing SS14 (RobustToolbox) YAML prototypes with schema
awareness. The extension lives at the repo root; see `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/`
for the domain model and design decisions, and issue
[#20](https://github.com/crystallpunk-14/SS14Editor/issues/20) for the v1 spec.

## Status

Issues [#21](https://github.com/crystallpunk-14/SS14Editor/issues/21) (skeleton),
[#23](https://github.com/crystallpunk-14/SS14Editor/issues/23) (fork detection)
and [#25](https://github.com/crystallpunk-14/SS14Editor/issues/25) (schema
connection): the extension contributes its own **SS14 Editor** activity-bar
container holding an **Inspector** webview view. That panel runs fork detection
on the workspace root and reports either the single concrete reason the folder is
not a built fork (no `RobustToolbox` submodule, no `Content.Server` /
`Content.Client` / `Resources/Prototypes`, no DLLs in `bin/Content.*`, or a stale
build) or, once it is, the schema verdict.

On a recognised fork the host runs the bundled schema extractor
(`dotnet assets/schema-cli/SS14Editor.SchemaCli.dll <forkRoot> <cacheDir>`),
caching its `metadata.json` under
`globalStorageUri/schema/<fork>-<hash>/` — never in the fork tree. It re-runs on
activation, on a debounced change to `bin/Content.{Server,Client}/*.dll`, and on
the **SS14: Rebuild schema** command; the CLI fingerprints its inputs and no-ops
when nothing changed. The parsed schema stays in memory for the provider tickets;
a `schemaVersion` the extension does not expect is reported as incompatible and
keeps providers down. No editing behaviour yet; later tickets build on this shell.

## Layout

| Path          | Layer                                                                       |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/core/`   | Pure TypeScript. **No `vscode` import** — the single test seam (lint-enforced). Fork detection, YAML core, and the schema contract + `interpretSchemaResult` verdict live here. |
| `src/host/`   | Thin VS Code adapter: activation, view registration, the real-FS `ForkFs`, running the schema CLI (`schema-controller.ts`), `WorkspaceEdit`. |
| `src/webview/`| Inspector UI bundle. ESM, loaded from one `<script type="module">`.         |
| `src/shared/` | Types shared by host and webview (the message protocol).                    |
| `media/`      | Static assets shipped in the `.vsix` (the activity-bar icon).               |
| `assets/`     | Build output shipped in the `.vsix` — the published schema extractor (`assets/schema-cli/`). Git-ignored; produced by `npm run build:schema-cli`. |

`esbuild.mjs` produces three independent bundles: `dist/extension.js` (host,
CommonJS), `dist/webview/main.js` (webview, ESM), and `out/test/smoke/` (the
activation test).

## Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint             # eslint (incl. the core/vscode import boundary)
npm run test:core        # vitest — fast, no VS Code
npm run test:smoke       # @vscode/test-electron activation smoke test
npm run build            # esbuild: host + webview + smoke bundles
npm run build:schema-cli # dotnet publish the extractor into assets/schema-cli/
npm run package          # build + build:schema-cli + vsce package -> ss14editor.vsix
```

## Schema extractor

The v1 spec pairs this extension with the vendored C# CLI in
[`schema-cli/`](schema-cli/) that extracts the schema from a fork's
compiled DLLs (issue #22). CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs
`dotnet publish -c Release` into `assets/schema-cli/` before the bundle
step, so the `.vsix` carries it. For a local F5 run against a real fork, run
`npm run build:schema-cli` once first — without it the panel reports the
extractor as not bundled.
